### Day 01 Lab Assignment

#### Step by step process

* Implemented fib function which takes a `num` argument and calculates the fibonacci number. (Same for the negative counter part as the posetive one).

* Modularize the function by moving it `computations` folder and reuse it from the `app.js`.

* Use the function in typical thread blocking way and observe the result

* Finally using `child_process` and creating separate process to calculate the fibonacci of `25` and `-17` respectively.
  
  * Modify the implementation of the fib function to accept arguments from the shell. That way it is possible to pass argument to fib function from the environment that the function is called.
